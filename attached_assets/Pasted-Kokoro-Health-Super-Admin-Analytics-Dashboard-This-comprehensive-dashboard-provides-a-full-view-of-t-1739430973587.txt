Kokoro Health Super-Admin Analytics Dashboard
This comprehensive dashboard provides a full view of the user journey from sign-up to ongoing engagement and success. It is tailored for a super-admin/CEO to monitor real-time performance and long-term trends. Clear visualizations (charts, tables, funnel diagrams) are used to highlight key metrics and insights at a glance.

1. User Sign-ups & Funnel Tracking
This section tracks how users move from initial sign-up through key onboarding steps, helping identify conversion rates and drop-off points in the funnel. Key components include:

Total Sign-Ups: A prominent KPI card showing the total number of user sign-ups (with options to view today, this week, or total to date). This gives a quick gauge of user acquisition.
Intro Call Booking Rate: A funnel chart illustrating the percentage of users who progress from sign-up to booking an intro call. For example, a funnel diagram might show: 100% Sign-ups → 60% Booked Intro Call. This visualization highlights conversion efficiency at a glance.
Drop-Off Analysis: Indicators for drop-off rates at each stage of the onboarding journey (e.g., account created, profile completed, intro call booked, first lesson started). A step-by-step funnel or bar chart can display the proportion of users continuing versus leaving at each step. This helps the CEO pinpoint where users lose interest or encounter friction.
2. Lesson & Program Engagement
This section monitors how users engage with Kokoro Health’s educational content and program over time. It highlights completion rates and content interaction to gauge program effectiveness:

Week 1 Completion: A metric showing the number (and percentage) of users who complete the first week of lessons. This could be displayed as a KPI card or a bar in a chart, indicating initial engagement level.
Subsequent Week Completions: A bar chart comparing the number of users completing each week of the program (Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, etc.). Each bar represents a week, allowing the CEO to see drop-off in engagement across the program. For instance, if 100 users complete Week 1 and 80 complete Week 2, the decline is immediately visible.
Content Engagement Levels: An engagement breakdown for different content types: videos, PDFs, and journaling sections. This might use a set of side-by-side bar charts or a multi-line chart to show how frequently users interact with each format. For example, it can show total video views vs. PDF downloads vs. journal entries created. A high-level summary could also be shown with a pie chart indicating the proportion of users engaging with all three versus just one or two content types.
Interactive Content Table (if needed): A table could list specific lessons or modules with metrics like completion rate, average time spent, or satisfaction rating. This gives more granular insight into which lessons are most engaging or where users might struggle.
3. Health Data Tracking
This section focuses on how users track their health metrics and the progress they achieve towards their health goals. It visualizes user input frequency and outcome trends:

Regular Health Updates: A gauge or KPI showing the percentage of active users who regularly update key health data (weight, waist circumference, blood glucose). For example, “70% of users updated at least one health metric this week.” This indicates how engaged users are in self-monitoring.
Average Weight Loss: A line chart displaying the average weight loss per week. This chart can be filtered by cohort or program week. It might show, for instance, that on average users lose 1.5 lbs in week 1, 1 lb in week 2, etc., highlighting the overall effectiveness of the program. Another visualization (such as a bar chart) can compare total average weight loss across different cohorts or time periods (e.g. Cohort A vs. Cohort B).
Health Goal Progress: A visual representation of progress toward health goals. This could be a progress bar or thermometer-style chart showing the aggregate percentage of goal achievement (e.g., on average users have achieved 50% of their weight loss goal). Additionally, a scatter plot or distribution chart might show the range of individual progress (to see how many users are 0–25%, 25–50%, etc. towards their goals). This helps the CEO understand overall outcomes and variance among users.
Biometric Data Trends: If needed, separate mini line charts for waist circumference and blood glucose trends can be shown. For example, a line chart for average waist circumference reduction over time, and another for average blood glucose improvements. These emphasize the health impact of the program beyond weight alone.
4. Subscription & Retention Analysis
This section analyzes how users convert from free trials to paid subscriptions and how long they stay. It highlights revenue-related metrics and user loyalty:

Free-to-Paid Conversion: A conversion funnel or set of KPI cards showing the rate at which users move from free trials to paid subscriptions. For clarity, a funnel diagram might show: 1000 Free Trial Users → 300 Converted to Monthly (30%) → 100 Converted to Yearly (10%). Alternatively, use a pie chart comparing current free vs. paid users, with color-coded segments for monthly and yearly subscribers.
Subscription Type Breakdown: A comparison of monthly vs. yearly subscriptions among paid users. This can be a donut chart or side-by-side bars indicating what percentage of paying users are on monthly plans versus annual plans. This helps the CEO see revenue stability (annual subscriptions) versus flexibility (monthly).
User Retention Rate: A line chart or area chart illustrating retention over time (e.g., percentage of users still active after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, etc.). This could be complemented by a cohort retention curve (each cohort’s retention plotted separately). Key retention KPIs can be highlighted (e.g., "3-month retention: 65%").
Churn Rate: A counterpart to retention, possibly displayed as a trend line showing the monthly churn percentage (the percentage of subscribers canceling each month). This helps identify if churn is improving or worsening over time.
Cancellation Trends & Reasons: If data on why users cancel is collected, a bar chart can list common cancellation reasons with their frequencies (e.g., "35% - Achieved Goals, 25% - Cost, 20% - Content Not Engaging, 20% - Other"). If reasons are not available, this section can still show a timeline of cancellations (for example, a line or bar chart of number of cancellations each month) to spot any spikes. Annotating the timeline with notable events (like price changes or feature releases) could provide context for those trends.
5. Cohort Analysis & Segmentation
This section allows the CEO to examine user behavior and outcomes by specific groups or cohorts, offering deeper insight into how different segments perform over time:

Cohort Performance Over Time: An interactive cohort analysis chart or table. For example, a retention table where each row is a cohort (grouped by sign-up month or quarter) and columns show the percentage of that cohort still active or completing the program after each successive week or month. This could also be visualized as multiple line charts on one graph (each line representing a cohort’s progress in a key metric like retention or average weight loss). This view lets the CEO compare how newer users versus earlier cohorts engage and retain.
Demographic & Goal Segmentation: Controls or filters to segment the data by user attributes such as demographics (age group, gender) or health goals (e.g., weight loss vs. blood sugar control). When a segment is selected, all relevant charts update to reflect that subgroup. For instance, the CEO can filter the dashboard to see engagement and outcomes for users under 40 years old, or see a comparison of users with different primary health goals. Segmented bar charts or pie charts could display the composition of the user base (for example, percentage of users in each age group or goal category).
Subscription Segment Analysis: The dashboard can also segment by subscription type (free, monthly, yearly) to compare behavior. For example, a CEO might compare the engagement charts for free users vs. paid users to see how paying customers differ in usage patterns. This could be shown side-by-side or via toggling between segments.
Outcome by Segment: Additional visualizations might include comparing average health outcomes by segment. For example, a grouped bar chart showing average weight loss for different age groups or for monthly vs yearly subscribers, highlighting how different segments succeed.
6. Live Group Session Attendance
This section tracks participation in Kokoro Health’s live group sessions, indicating how many users take advantage of community support and how engaged they are during these sessions:

Weekly Session Attendance: A line chart showing the number of participants in each weekly live session over time. Peaks or dips in the line help identify trends (e.g., increasing attendance as the user base grows, or drop-offs during holidays). Each data point represents one session’s attendee count; hovering could show the exact number and date. Alternatively, a bar chart could show attendance for the last several sessions individually.
Session Engagement Levels: Metrics to gauge engagement during the sessions. This might include a KPI like Average Participation Rate (e.g., percentage of attendees who spoke or commented) or Questions Asked per Session. Visualization could be a simple bar or gauge indicating engagement (for example, 80% engagement rate in the most recent session). If polls or quizzes are used in sessions, a small table or chart could show average poll participation or results. This helps the CEO understand not just attendance quantity, but quality of interaction.
Attendance vs. User Base: A supplementary visualization could be a derived metric like percentage of active users attending live sessions. This could be shown as a single number (e.g., "Live Session Participation: 30% of active users") or a pie chart split between attendees and non-attendees in a given week. It contextualizes session reach relative to the total user base.
7. Time Filters & Historical Trends
Because the CEO needs to monitor both real-time and long-term performance, the dashboard includes flexible time filtering and trend visualizations:

Date Range Filters: At the top of the dashboard, controls allow switching between time frames (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or custom date ranges). Selecting a time filter updates all charts and metrics on the dashboard to the chosen period. For example, choosing "Monthly" might show sign-ups per month, retention of cohorts by month, etc., whereas "Weekly" could zoom in on more granular weekly changes.
Historical Trend Charts: Key metrics are accompanied by line charts to visualize their trajectory over time. For instance, alongside the total sign-ups KPI, a small sparkline or line chart might show sign-ups by day for the past 30 days. Similarly, retention or average weight loss might include a trend line across multiple periods or cohorts. These help identify growth rates, seasonal patterns, or the impact of new initiatives.
Comparison Over Time: The dashboard could allow comparing two date ranges (e.g., this month vs last month, or the same month last year) for seasonality insight. Trend charts might include year-over-year lines or percentage change indicators next to metrics (for example, "Sign-ups: 120 this week (▲15% vs. last week)"). This temporal context is valuable for strategic assessment.
Real-Time Highlights: For real-time monitoring, certain metrics could auto-refresh. For example, if the app tracks live usage, a small indicator could show the number of users currently online or actions in the last hour. This real-time widget ensures the CEO can catch any sudden changes in usage as they happen.
8. Admin View Customization
The dashboard is optimized for a CEO’s overview, consolidating critical information in one place. It also offers customization options to focus on what matters most:

Unified CEO Dashboard: All the above sections are arranged on a single screen (with scrolling if necessary), logically grouped so the CEO can easily scan from high-level metrics to more detailed analyses. For instance, the top of the dashboard might feature a Key Metrics Summary (sign-ups, conversion rate, active users, revenue metrics) in a set of highlight cards or an overview bar. Below that, sections like funnel, engagement, and health outcomes are laid out with clear headings. This one-page approach means less navigation and a holistic view of company performance at a glance.
Layout and Widget Customization: The super-admin can customize the view to some extent. They might rearrange sections, resize charts, or choose which key metrics appear in the top summary. For example, if the CEO is particularly interested in retention, they could pin the retention chart to the top. The design uses a modular widget layout, so each chart or KPI tile can be moved or configured (e.g., switching a chart between absolute numbers and percentages).
Real-Time vs Historical Toggle: The CEO view may include toggles or tabs for switching between real-time data (e.g., live usage, today’s sign-ups) and cumulative historical data. By default, the dashboard might show current KPIs with a historical trend context, but the CEO could switch to a “Live Mode” emphasizing the most recent data streams. Conversely, a “Historical Details” mode could expand trend charts for deeper analysis.
Alerts and Highlights: Important changes or milestones are highlighted on the dashboard. For example, if the conversion rate drops below a threshold or a new record number of weekly sign-ups is achieved, the dashboard can flag this with color highlights or small alert icons. This ensures that significant deviations in performance catch the CEO’s eye immediately.
Export & Reporting Options: Although primarily a live dashboard, the admin view can allow exporting data or charts for reporting. The CEO could download a PDF summary or schedule a weekly email report containing snapshots of these key metrics. This complements the dashboard for sharing with other stakeholders or for offline review.

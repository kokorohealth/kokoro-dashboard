7. Time Filters & Historical Trends
Because the CEO needs to monitor both real-time and long-term performance, the dashboard includes flexible time filtering and trend visualizations:

Date Range Filters: At the top of the dashboard, controls allow switching between time frames (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or custom date ranges). Selecting a time filter updates all charts and metrics on the dashboard to the chosen period. For example, choosing "Monthly" might show sign-ups per month, retention of cohorts by month, etc., whereas "Weekly" could zoom in on more granular weekly changes.
Historical Trend Charts: Key metrics are accompanied by line charts to visualize their trajectory over time. For instance, alongside the total sign-ups KPI, a small sparkline or line chart might show sign-ups by day for the past 30 days. Similarly, retention or average weight loss might include a trend line across multiple periods or cohorts. These help identify growth rates, seasonal patterns, or the impact of new initiatives.
Comparison Over Time: The dashboard could allow comparing two date ranges (e.g., this month vs last month, or the same month last year) for seasonality insight. Trend charts might include year-over-year lines or percentage change indicators next to metrics (for example, "Sign-ups: 120 this week (▲15% vs. last week)"). This temporal context is valuable for strategic assessment.
Real-Time Highlights: For real-time monitoring, certain metrics could auto-refresh. For example, if the app tracks live usage, a small indicator could show the number of users currently online or actions in the last hour. This real-time widget ensures the CEO can catch any sudden changes in usage as they happen.
8. Admin View Customization
The dashboard is optimized for a CEO’s overview, consolidating critical information in one place. It also offers customization options to focus on what matters most:

Unified CEO Dashboard: All the above sections are arranged on a single screen (with scrolling if necessary), logically grouped so the CEO can easily scan from high-level metrics to more detailed analyses. For instance, the top of the dashboard might feature a Key Metrics Summary (sign-ups, conversion rate, active users, revenue metrics) in a set of highlight cards or an overview bar. Below that, sections like funnel, engagement, and health outcomes are laid out with clear headings. This one-page approach means less navigation and a holistic view of company performance at a glance.
Layout and Widget Customization: The super-admin can customize the view to some extent. They might rearrange sections, resize charts, or choose which key metrics appear in the top summary. For example, if the CEO is particularly interested in retention, they could pin the retention chart to the top. The design uses a modular widget layout, so each chart or KPI tile can be moved or configured (e.g., switching a chart between absolute numbers and percentages).
Real-Time vs Historical Toggle: The CEO view may include toggles or tabs for switching between real-time data (e.g., live usage, today’s sign-ups) and cumulative historical data. By default, the dashboard might show current KPIs with a historical trend context, but the CEO could switch to a “Live Mode” emphasizing the most recent data streams. Conversely, a “Historical Details” mode could expand trend charts for deeper analysis.
Alerts and Highlights: Important changes or milestones are highlighted on the dashboard. For example, if the conversion rate drops below a threshold or a new record number of weekly sign-ups is achieved, the dashboard can flag this with color highlights or small alert icons. This ensures that significant deviations in performance catch the CEO’s eye immediately.
Export & Reporting Options: Although primarily a live dashboard, the admin view can allow exporting data or charts for reporting. The CEO could download a PDF summary or schedule a weekly email report containing snapshots of these key metrics. This complements the dashboard for sharing with other stakeholders or for offline review.

4. Subscription & Retention Analysis
This section analyzes how users convert from free trials to paid subscriptions and how long they stay. It highlights revenue-related metrics and user loyalty:

Free-to-Paid Conversion: A conversion funnel or set of KPI cards showing the rate at which users move from free trials to paid subscriptions. For clarity, a funnel diagram might show: 1000 Free Trial Users → 300 Converted to Monthly (30%) → 100 Converted to Yearly (10%). Alternatively, use a pie chart comparing current free vs. paid users, with color-coded segments for monthly and yearly subscribers.
Subscription Type Breakdown: A comparison of monthly vs. yearly subscriptions among paid users. This can be a donut chart or side-by-side bars indicating what percentage of paying users are on monthly plans versus annual plans. This helps the CEO see revenue stability (annual subscriptions) versus flexibility (monthly).
User Retention Rate: A line chart or area chart illustrating retention over time (e.g., percentage of users still active after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, etc.). This could be complemented by a cohort retention curve (each cohort’s retention plotted separately). Key retention KPIs can be highlighted (e.g., "3-month retention: 65%").
Churn Rate: A counterpart to retention, possibly displayed as a trend line showing the monthly churn percentage (the percentage of subscribers canceling each month). This helps identify if churn is improving or worsening over time.
Cancellation Trends & Reasons: If data on why users cancel is collected, a bar chart can list common cancellation reasons with their frequencies (e.g., "35% - Achieved Goals, 25% - Cost, 20% - Content Not Engaging, 20% - Other"). If reasons are not available, this section can still show a timeline of cancellations (for example, a line or bar chart of number of cancellations each month) to spot any spikes. Annotating the timeline with notable events (like price changes or feature releases) could provide context for those trends.
